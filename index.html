        <h1 class="name">Nattawat Pitikomon</h1>
        <p class="job">ARCHITECT + UX + DEV</p>
        <p class="about">
          I am Nattawat Pitikomon, a skilled architect with 1.5 years of
          experience. My focus on technology and interest in UX design and
          coding have motivated me to pursue new career opportunities in these
          fields. Through my thesis work on esports architecture, I gained
          experience conducting research from scratch, which I believe would be
          helpful in UX design. In addition, I have had the chance to work with
          a diverse range of clients during my time as an architect. I Chave
          collaborated with Singaporean clients and their British boss, allowing
          me to gain invaluable insight into different cultural perspectives. I
          have also participated in university co-workshops in Vietnam and
          Japan, further broadening my multicultural experiences. My dedication
          to inclusivity is a key element of my work, as I believe that everyone
          deserves a voice and a chance to be included. Let's connect and
          explore how my unique blend of skills and experience can support your
          team's goals.
